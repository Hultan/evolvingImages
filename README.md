This a version of EvolvingPictures that was created by Jack Mott : [github](https://github.com/jackmott/gameswithgo-public)

You can find his youtube channel and the playlist here : [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YvStSI0FIk&list=PLDZujg-VgQlZUy1iCqBbe5faZLMkA3g2x&index=16)

I decided to go with RayLib ([Go-bindings](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go)) instead of SDL.
